# whatsyoursign
A site for using science to take fate into your own hands. 

users can input their current desired sign, and are shown steps necessary to change their sign to the desired.

a demo project for how to build an interactive website.

distributed under GPL, for how it uses the Swiss Ephemeris.

depends on having access to a backend with the swiss ephemeris, which was surprisingly easy to install.


Resources used:

TODO
currently using average distances to solar body.  emphemeris reports real distance, so cound compute counter on the fly
currently using only degree angle to solar body.  emphemeris reports minutes and seconds as well; greater acuracy
site only shows sun sign.  using more objects for more bodies would be busy, but fun.
site could be generalized to other zodiac systems (chinese)
site could be generalized from newborns to events
